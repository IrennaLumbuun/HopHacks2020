# HopHacks2020

## Inspiration
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, medical consultations for non-urgent conditions are switched to online. Current telemedicine apps only provide video consultation and electronic medical records. Limited health information can be collected and the diagnosis process is ineffective.
Our idea is to increase the amount of useful information collected to aid diagnosis including facial recognition, voice recognition, and vital signs.

## What it does
- Patients can sign up with their email, name, and create a password
- Patients can log in with their email and password
- Patients can upload their photos to the system
- Patients can get the results link from the system and forward to their doctor

## What's next for Prognomic
### New Features
Doctor portal
- Doctors can sign up with their work email, name, and create a password
- Doctors can log in with their email and password
- Doctors can import patient record or add patients during onboarding
- Doctors can request photos from patients to upload to the system
- Doctors can view the photos in the system and the machine learning model results
- Doctors can add comments/ medications/ recommendations/ medical conditions to patientâ€™s record
